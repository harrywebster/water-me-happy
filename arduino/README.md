# Arduino apps

## Module 1

We need an app to run on the arduino to verify that the water pump, battery pack, switching board, wiring and moisture sensor is all working correctly. If they don't then hours or days can be lost later trying to debug.

If in the future something isn't working quite as you expect it to, come back to this module to ensure your problem is not hardware related.
