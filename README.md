# water-me-happy

## Introduction

After deciding to start a veg-patch in my garden with my kids, i thought, being a programmer 'n all, i should geek this up a bit.

Using a Raspberry Pi, Arduino, pumps, tubing, sensors etc we will build a watering system that will be controled via a "game".

## Prerequsites for proof of concept

* Raspberry Pi 4B
* Mega 2560 prototyping board
* JT-DC3W x 4 - HYS Water Pomp DC 3V 4.5V Submersible
* 1 meter of tubing
* Soil moisture sensor x 4
